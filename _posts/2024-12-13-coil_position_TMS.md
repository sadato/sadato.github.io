title: Coil positioning for TMS

![ ](/images/graph.png)

International 10-20 electroencephalography system positions that serve as targets for rTMS in different disorders. For chronic pain, the target is the motor cortex contralateral to the pain; in stroke rehabilitation, the inhibitory protocol targets the contralateral motor cortex, while the excitatory protocol delivers stimuli over the affected cerebral hemisphere; for major depressive disorder, high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or low frequency rTMS over the right DLPFC are indicated.

Detailed descriptions of these and other protocols can be found in my book [Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Primer](https://a.co/d/4k7cX9r)
